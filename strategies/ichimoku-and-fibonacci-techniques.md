# Ichimoku and Fibonacci Techniques

## Components of Ichimoku Kinko Hyo

* The Ichimoku cloud \(Japanese name: Kumo\)
* The base line \(Japanese name: Kijun\)
* The turn line \(Japanese name: Tenkan\)
* The delay span \(Japanese name: Chiko\)

### Buy signals

* If the price is moving above the Ichimoku cloud, this movement may indicate a bullish momentum in the market and is therefore a buy signal.
* When the Chiko \(delayed\) line moves above the cloud, it can be considered a buy signal.
* When the Tenkan \(turn\) line crosses above the Kijun \(base\) line, that crossing may indicate a shift in the market sentiment from bearish to bullish and therefore be a buy signal.

### Sell signals

* When the price moves below the Ichimoku cloud
* When the Chiko \(delayed\) line crosses below the cloud
* When the Tenkan \(turn\) line crosses below the Kijun \(base\) line

### Other common interpretations

* As long as the five lines are parallel, the trend will continue in that direction.
* When the prices are inside the Ichimoku cloud, that means that the market is in the process of consolidating, which isn’t a good time to buy or sell.
* You can use the lower band of the prevailing cloud as a layer of support, which is a level that the price has difficulty breaking below.
* You can use the upper band of the prevailing cloud as a layer of resistance, which is a price that the market has difficulty breaking above

Shows the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo components in action on a chart that displays the price action of Ripple \(XRP\) versus Bitcoin \(BTC\) on a four-hour \(or 240-minute\) basis. That means each of the candlesticks \(see Chapter 16\) shows the price movements of XRP versus BTC in four hours. The Ichimoku components dance around the prices, crossing above and below the price action depending on the calculations. You can take these movements as indications about the future price direction.

## Fibonacci Retracement Levels

### Fibonacci sequence

* the series of numbers, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144
* 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5
* ratios calculated: 34 / 55 = 0.618 -&gt; technical analysis consists of ratios:  0.78, 0.618, 0.5, 0.382, 0.236

### Insert Fibonacci retracement levels into your chart

1. Find a trend in the prices.
2. Find the Fibonacci retracement tool on your cart and click on it.
3. Click to apply the Fibonacci tool to the bottom of the trend \(if it’s an uptrend\) or to the top of the trend \(if it’s a downtrend\).
4. Drag the Fibonacci tool to the other end of the trend and then click again to drop the Fibonacci retracement levels on the chart.

shows the price action of Stellar Lumens \(XLM\) versus Bitcoin \(BTC\) in a four-hour chart. The bottom of the trend for the XLM/BTC pair is at 0.00003309, and the top of the trend is at 0.00003901. By dragging the Fibonacci tool from the bottom to the top, you can see the Fibonacci retracement levels marked as 0.78, 0.618, 0.5, 0.382, and 0.236.

## Combining Ichimoku and Fibonacci Techniques

Figure 20-4 shows a case study on the XLM/BTC four-hour chart where I’ve identified an Ichimoku-based bearish signal after the price broke below the Ichimoku cloud at 0.00003579. Based on the Ichimoku strategy, you can create a sell limit order either at the lower band of the Ichimoku cloud \(0.00003579\) or a bit higher at the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level of 0.00003605.

For profit taking, you can consider the 0.786 Fibonacci level at 0.00003435. For traders who like using stop-losses, you can use the 0.382 Fibonacci level or higher, depending on your risk tolerance. \(For simplicity, I’m not mentioning other bearish signals that you can find on this chart.\) A stop-loss is an order you can put through your broker to get you out of a losing trade before the losses get out of hand; flip to Chapter 17 for more info.
