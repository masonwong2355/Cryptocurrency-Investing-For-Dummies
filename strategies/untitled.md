# Long-Term Investing Strategies

## Getting Started with Long-Term Investing

### Your personal goals and current situation

* What’s your income size now, and where can it go in the future?
* Are you likely to change your job in the future? Is your current job secure?
* What’s your marital status now? Do you have any children? Where do you see yourself on this front in five years?
* What’s your investment experience?
* Do you have any other investments in assets such as equities or real estate? How diversified is your overall portfolio?

### consider variables

* Your current income
* Your age
* The size of your family
* Your risk preferences

### Types of portfolio’s objectives

* **Generating current income**: generate a regular payment
* **Preserving capital**: conservative investment strategy generates moderate returns.
* **Growing capital**: Focusing on capital growth 
* **Reducing taxes**:  If you’re in a lower tax bracket, you have lower incentive to defer taxes and earn high investment returns, so a portfolio with higher-current-income assets may be suitable for you.
* **Managing risk**: You should always consider the risk-return trade-off in all investment decisions

current income and capital preservation are good objectives for someone with a low risk tolerance who has a conservative personality If you have medium risk tolerance and don’t need to depend on your investment for current income as much, you can select capital growth as your portfolio objective In many countries, including the United States, taxes also play a major role in your investment goals.

### Creating Long-Term Strategies

#### Observing psychological levels

* find a great deal about investing crowd psychology in plain
* Buy at a key support level and sell at a key resistance level.
* Buy at current market price and sell at a key resistance level.
* Wait for a pullback when the price reaches a key resistance level and buy lower. Then sell at the next key resistance level.
* Buy at a key support level and hold long term

**Markets may continue to go up after you sell. Don’t let your emotions take over your logical decision to sell. If you need the money and have already achieved your investment goal, you have no reason to regret an early sale.**

#### Keeping tax consequences in mind

#### Considering Limit and Stop-Loss Orders

* **Limit orders** is a type of transaction order that allows you to buy or sell at your preferred price
  * buy limit order
    * good til canceled \(GTC\) order normally stays in effect for six months.
    * fill-or-kill order is canceled if it’s not immediately executed. For short-term trading strategies.  
  * sell limit order
  * different options for how long they stay in effect
  * I’ve set a buy limit order for Bitcoin versus U.S. dollar \(BTC/USD\) to purchase 0.4 Bitcoins when the price reaches $6,000. On the order form, I’ve also added a good til canceled buy limit order to buy 0.2 Bitcoins at $5,851. By having multiple limit orders, I eliminate the risk of missing out and avoid going all in at one price.
* **Stop-loss orders** limit the downside loss exposure of your crypto investment.
  * Volatile markets such as cryptocurrencies normally bounce back up from the lows as rapidly as they fall. That’s why by using a stop-loss order, you may end up getting out of your position prematurely and miss out on potential gains.
