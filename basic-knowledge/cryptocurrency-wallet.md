## Choosing a Crypto Wallet

### Based on security

* Even if you’re an active crypto trader, I recommend that you have a super secure cold wallet where you store your larger amounts of crypto assets.
* most secure hardware wallets are normally the most expensive on
  * What sort of authentication does the wallet use?
  * Is the website secure?
  * What do online reviews say?
* check security e.g. CoinCentral.com, 99Bitcoins.com, and CryptoCompare.com are among the websites that provide an annual crypto wallet review.

### Based on your crypto ownership

* Not all crypto wallets can handle your different types of cryptocurrency assets.
* e.g. Coinomi\(mobile wallet\), Exodus\(desktop wallet\)

### Based on transaction fees

* prioritizing anonymity may affect transaction fees and the price of the wallet.
* e.g. BitLox, Electrum, Samourai
