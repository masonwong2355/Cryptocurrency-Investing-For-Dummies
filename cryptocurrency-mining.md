# Cryptocurrency Mining

* Get a crypto wallet .
* Make sure you have a strong Internet connection.
* Set up your high-end computer in a cool location. By cool, I literally mean “low temperature” and not “stylish.”
* Select the hardware to use based on the cryptocurrency you want to mine. I explain more about this in the next two sections.
* If you want to mine solo \(not recommended\), download the whole cryptocurrency’s blockchain. Be prepared; for mature cryptos, downloading the whole blockchain may take days.
* Get a mining software package \(flip to the later section on software for more\).
* Join a mining pool. I explain more later in this chapter.
* Make sure your expenses aren’t exceeding your rewards. I explain more later in this chapter

### See which cryptos are best to mine at a given time \(www.coinwarz.com\)

### Even if mining isn’t profitable at the moment, your cryptos can be worth a lot in the future if the coin value surges.

### Mining hardware: ASIC miner

## Mining software

* CGminer, Bitcoin, supports ASICs and GPUs
* Ethminer, Ethereum, GPU hardware such as Nvidia and AMD
* XMR Stak, Monero and Aeon, supports CPU and GPU

## Mining pools

* Minable cryptocurrency

* Fees
* Profit sharing:  how much of the coin you need to mine before the pool pays you out.

## profitability depends on many factors

* computing power, electricity costs, pool fees, and the Bitcoin’s value at the time of mining
