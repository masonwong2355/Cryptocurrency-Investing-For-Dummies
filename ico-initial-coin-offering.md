## Outlining the ICO investment process

1. Make sure you check the official page of the ICO.
2. If the ICO requires you to pay by another crypto, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin, you must first acquire those coins on an exchange \(see Chapter 6\) and store

    them in your crypto wallet \(see Chapter 7\).

3. After completing your due diligence on the ICO’s nature \(see the earlier section “Analyzing an ICO listing”\), register for the ICO based on its website’s instructions.
4. Wait for the launch date and follow the instructions. This step normally consists of transferring your cryptocurrency assets from your crypto wallet to

    the ICO’s public address. This step may also cost a transaction fee.

5. After the ICO is launched, the team sends the new tokens to your crypto wallet.
