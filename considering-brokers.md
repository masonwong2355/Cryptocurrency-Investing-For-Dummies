# Considering Brokers

## Pros

* You get improved liquidity
* higher chance of getting your buy/sell orders fulfilled in a timely manner

## Cons

### You can’t invest in cryptos as an asset.

* This distinction means you don’t own your cryptos even if you buy them on the brokerage account.

  **You don’t have access to wallets.**

* no real portfolio or wallet is available for you.

## Pro or con

* You can trade on leverage
* Trading on leverage means borrowing money from your broker to trade.
* Using leverage can be an advantage if you know what you’re doing and you have

    high enough risk tolerance to be prepared for a worst-case scenario, which means

    losing parts or all of your initial investment through the broker.

## How to choose a broker

### Make sure it’s regulated

* Your best bet is often to make sure the broker is regulated by two or more regulatory bodies in your country. 

### Consider ease of deposit and withdrawals

### Beware of promotions

* need to do your due diligence and know your broker before you take advantage of a promotion.
