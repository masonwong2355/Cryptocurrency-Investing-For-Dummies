# Identifying Top Performing Cryptocurrencies

## Invest Diva Diamond Analysis \(IDDA\)

1. Fundamental analysis
   * As a fundamental analyst, you look at data from facts to rumors to decide whether that coin is worth buying.
2. Sentimental \(market sentiment\) analysis
   * Market sentiment gauges the emotions and attitudes of traders in the market about a specific security. Using sentimental analysis, even non-animal-lovers in the investing world compare market expectations to bulls and bears.
   * If traders expect upward price movement of a specific security, the sentiment is said to be bullish. On the contrary, if the market sentiment is bearish, most traders expect downward price movement.
3. Technical analysis
   * As a technical analyst, you look at how a cryptocurrency’s price has been performing, and then you make an investment decision that is right for you. More specifically, you analyze the price action of your favorite cryptocurrency to see the best time to jump into a relationship and a good time to call it quits. You can see the history of the crypto price actions on something called charts that are available on your cryptocurrency exchange
4. Capital analysis \(personal risk management\)
