# Technical Analysis

**Many market participants use the same technical analysis methods, investors who spot them early can get an edge in their strategy development and get better-than-average returns**

## Chart

* Line charts
* Bar charts \([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RghwgzNgZ64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RghwgzNgZ64).\)
* Candlestick charts

## Spotting the Key Levels

### Support levels

* A support level is a barrier that prevents the prices from going lower.
* If a price level keeps “supporting” the cryptocurrency’s value from dropping lower, you can mark it as a support level.
* Notice I say “around.” Support levels aren’t always a concrete number.
* after strong support is broken, the market sentiment runs a good chance of shifting to bearish and starting to drop lower toward the next support levels.

### Resistance levels

* Resistance is a barrier that prevents the prices from going higher
* looking for peaks on the chart

### Fibonacci retracement levels

* To find support and resistance level

### Moving averages \(MAs\)

**\*\*\*\*Cryptocurrency market often acts in an arbitrary fashion,** never rely on only one method of analysis

### Basic moving averages

* if you look at a daily chart, you can select a short-term moving average that calculates a series of 15 data points. This figure is called a 15-day moving average, or a fast MA. If you want to see a longer-term average movement, you can use a longer period, such as 200 days, and call it a slow MA.

### Sophisticated moving averages

* Moving average convergence divergence \(MACD\): MACD is an indicator that shows the difference between a short-term moving average and a long-term moving average \([https://investdiva.com/investing-guide/macd/](https://investdiva.com/investing-guide/macd/)\)
* Bollinger Bands: includes two bands above and below the market price \([https://investdiva.com/investing-guide/bollinger-bands-bol/](https://investdiva.com/investing-guide/bollinger-bands-bol/)\)
* Relative strength index \(RSI\): RSI is a momentum indicator, or oscillator, that measures the relative internal strength of the cryptocurrency’s price against itself \([www.investdiva.com/ investing-guide/relative-strength-index-rsi/](diversification-in-cryptocurrencies.md)\)
* Ichimoku Kinko Hyo: it consists of five different MAs all on top of each other. It gives you all you need to know all at once
